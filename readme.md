#Droplet: Localized Anonymous Image Sharing

Droplet is a new way to share and see what's going on around you using your iPhone.

##Requirements
Due to the fact that it uses the camera, Droplet must be run on a real iOS device.
Droplet also requires *Alamofire* as a package to be installed and included in the repository when using it locally.

##Installation
1. Clone the repository onto your local machine
2. Add [*Alamofire*](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) to your project directory
3. Open the project in XCode
4. Add *Alamofire* by importing the files and ensuring they are included in your Linked Frameworks & Libraries
5. Run Droplet on a real iOS device

##Structure
This project contains three storyboard files, view controllers, models, and tests. All image assets are included in the Assets.xcassets directory.
All code has specific comments and notes about its use.
